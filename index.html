    <h1> What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h1>
    <p>I liked how the videos, the slides, and the class assignment cover everything we are 
        learning for the week. Every component is very well organized.</p>

        <h1> What would you change about the course?</h1>
        <p> honestly would not change anything about the course. I was exposed 
            to a lot of information, retaining the information is a different story.</p>

            <h1> Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course?</h1>
            <p> I definitely learned more than I expected and enjoyed working outside of my 
                comfort zone, the whole semester. 

            </p>

            <h1>What concepts were new to you, and what concepts have you already encountered in the past?</h1>
            <p>
                Everything was new to me, I was not familiar with any web design programming.
                 I've enjoyed learning a new trade, and Id like to continue to challenge myself by
                 continuing computer programming classes.  
            </p>
